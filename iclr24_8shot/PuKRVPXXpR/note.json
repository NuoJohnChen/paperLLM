            "value": "This paper considers a vertex classification task where we are given a graph and associated vector features.\nThe modern approach to this task is graph neural networks (GNNs). \nHowever, due to the nature of GNN architectures, GNNs are known to be biased to primarily learn homophilous information.\nTo overcome this bias in GNN architectures, we take a simpler alternative approach to GNNs.\nOur approach is to obtain a vector representation capturing both features and the graph topology.\nWe then apply standard vector-based learning methods to this vector representation.\nFor this approach, we propose a simple transformation of features, which we call \\textit{Resistance Transformation} (abbreviated as \\textit{ResTran}).\nWe provide theoretical justifications for ResTran from the effective resistance, $k$-means, and spectral clustering points of view.\nWe empirically demonstrate that ResTran is more robust to the homophilous bias than established GNN methods."
