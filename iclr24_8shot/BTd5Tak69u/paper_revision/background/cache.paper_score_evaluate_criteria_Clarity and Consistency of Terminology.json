    "after_improvement": "**O**bject-**C**entric **L**earning (OCL) is a method for compositional scene perception that emphasizes the independent learning of representations for individual objects within a scene. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the interactions and characteristics of objects, facilitating better scene interpretation and analysis.",
    "explanation": "The revised version clarifies the definition of Object-Centric Learning (OCL) by emphasizing its role in compositional scene perception and its focus on independent learning of object representations. This change enhances clarity by explicitly stating the benefits of this approach, which aligns with the standard conventions in the field of object-centric learning. The term \"compositional scene perception\" is retained to maintain consistency with the terminology used throughout the paper, ensuring that readers can easily connect this definition with the broader context of the research. Additionally, the phrase \"facilitating better scene interpretation and analysis\" provides a clearer understanding of the implications of OCL, addressing potential ambiguities in the original text."
