      "content": "The paper introduces a new method for approximating the graph Laplacian's eigenvalues and eigenvectors without reliance on sensitive hyperparameters. It presents a reformulated minimax objective that theoretically ensures the unique stable equilibrium point is the Laplacian representation (namely eigenvectors), which is important for learning representations in reinforcement learning. The paper claims this objective is both hyperparameter-independent and theoretically sound. Some experiments are provided to justify the new method. \n\nStrengths:\n1) Theoretical side: The proposed method provides a new interesting approach and the paper provides a strong theoretical underpinning for its proposed objective, showing that it converges to the correct solutions independently of hyperparameters.\n\n2) Practical Implementation: The method is demonstrated to work well in experiments and is shown to be applicable to high-dimensional problems, which is valuable for reinforcement learning applications.\n\nWeakness: \n\n1) Clarity in Application: Reviewers initially found it unclear how the theoretical results related to deep learning implementation, suggesting a potential gap in the presentation.\n\n2) Demonstration on Simple Environments: There was some criticism that the environments used in the initial experiments were too simple, though this was later addressed by including more complex, pixel-based environments in subsequent experiments.\n\n3) Stability Analysis: One reviewer pointed out that the stability analysis of the proposed objective might be insufficient, although the authors believe Theorem 1 addresses this concern.\n\nThree reviewers appreciated the novel reformulation, despite of those concerns on the current manuscript. They gave scores above the acceptance borderline. One reviewer submitted an irrelevant or wrong review, and did not response in and after the discussion period, which is thus ignored.",

          "content": "The paper develops three methods for smoothing in state-space models (SSMs). The idea is to assume SSMs that are non-linear and avoid other assumptions like Gaussianity when using variational inference. The drivin gidea is to preserve the temporal structure in the variational proposal. This seems to lead to what is called exponential family dynamical systems, that it a double-looped (forward and backward) chain of markovian conditionals.",

The work itself is clear and concise on the details, also mentioning limitations and reasoning on why certain decisions are taken.",
        "weaknesses": "To me the paper has two main weaknesses:\n\n[w1] \u2014 the paper is in general concise and thorough, but written in a way that the smoothing idea is kind of lost. Particularly, technical details jump in for solving issues of previous technical details (derivations begin at the beginning of pp. 2 and finish at the end of pp. 7). In that way, the paper loses quite a lot of space, and story on the general smoothing idea that authors want to solve (and in which way they want to solve it). \n\n[w2] \u2014 the second concern to me is the limited results. Having derived long technical details, the manuscript should at least provide results proportional to the technical development. In my opinion, the evaluation of the model is somehow short (learning of two synthetic systems (pendulum and chaotic scenario) plus analysis on convergence).",

          "content": "This paper proposes a new method for approximating the graph Laplacian (and namely its eigenvectors) over a discrete state space. This paper builds off of the \"graph drawing objective\" (and \"generalized graph drawing objective\"), with the goal to eliminate hyperparameters in its optimization that have been shown to sensitively effect the output approximation of the graph Laplacian's eigenvectors. It achieves this goal with a reformulated minimax objective, and provides both theory and experiments to justify this novel objective.",

The objective of the paper is clear and well-presented (re-formulate the graph drawing objective with a smaller hyperparameter space), the solution is clearly presented (convert into a max-min game, in spirit as a replacement to these hyperparameters), and the theory is both mathematically sound and interpretable to understand why the max-min game here achieves the desired objective.\n- While the proposed solution appears \"simple\" on paper, the theory and justification behind the method is both theoretically rich and clever, combining both a nice environment for theoreticians and a direct benefit for practitioners (less hyperparameters to tune alongside the rest of the system).",
        "weaknesses": "- The primary limitation is my view is the lack of justification in the practical context. Experiments are only provided in very simple maze scenarios, and it is not demonstrated here (or in primary related work I saw) why, in practice, one would chose a Laplacian representation over a standard representation.\n  - On a similar note, there lacks more thorough discussion on the stability of the now-induced minimax game. This likewise seems like something necessary in order to demonstrate practical utility of this framework, at least theoretically.\n\nNonetheless, I feel these weaknesses do not bar this paper from being a good publication as it is. It very clearly and concisely establishes the new method for Laplacian representation learning, and even if this framework is not currently in mainstream practical usage, it gives a solid and approachable platform for future research in improving both theory (e.g. stability of the minimax game could constitute an entirely separate paper) and practice (e.g. implementing standard RL engineering tricks to push practical performance over standard RL methods in certain scenarios).\n\n(However, as a side note, perhaps the current title is a bit presumptuous until such further theory and experimentation has been established.)",
        "questions": "- As there are natural continuous analogs to the graph Laplacion in Euclidean spaces, I am curious how, at least in theory, this framework is extendible into continuous state and action spaces? What are the limitations in extending this theory to continuous settings?",
