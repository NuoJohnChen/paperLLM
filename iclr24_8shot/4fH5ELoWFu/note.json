            "value": "Adversarial examples pose a security threat to many critical systems built on neural networks (such as face recognition systems and self-driving cars). While many methods have been proposed to build robust models, how to build certifiably robust yet accurate neural network models remains an open problem. For example, adversarial training improves empirical robustness, but they do not provide certification of the model's robustness. Conversely, certified training provides certified robustness but at the cost of a significant accuracy drop. In this work, we propose a novel approach that aims to achieve both high accuracy and certified probabilistic robustness. Our method has two parts which together achieve our goal, \\emph{i.e.}, a probabilistic robust training method with an additional goal of minimizing variance in divergence in a given vicinity and a runtime inference method for certified probabilistic robustness of the predictions. Compared to alternative methods such as randomized smoothing and certified training, our approach avoids introducing strong noise during training, is effective against a variety of perturbations, and most importantly, achieves certified probabilistic robustness without sacrificing accuracy. Our experiments on multiple models trained on different datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both certification rate and accuracy."
