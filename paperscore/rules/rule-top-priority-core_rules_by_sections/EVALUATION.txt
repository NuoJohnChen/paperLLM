**Mistake Name**: Unclear Experimental Setup
**Target Section**: EVALUATION
**Description**: Evaluate if the experimental setup (e.g., hardware/software configurations, parameter settings) is described comprehensively, allowing others to fully understand and reproduce the experimental conditions.
**How to Check**: Verify if the paper provides all necessary information about the experimental setup. This includes, but is not limited to, hardware and software configurations, parameter settings, algorithms used, data preprocessing steps, experimental conditions, and methods for handling exceptions or unexpected results.
**How to Solve**: Elucidate all aspects of the experimental setup in detail. Provide exact specifications for hardware/software configurations, document all parameter settings, and explain the rationale behind selecting these configurations and settings. Describe all experiment-related procedures comprehensively and methodically to ensure that someone else with the same resources could replicate the experiment exactly. Include any techniques, procedures, or strategies employed to manage contingencies during the experiment.

**Mistake Name**: Insufficient Analysis of Figures and Tables  
**Target Section**: Evaluation  
**Description**: The evaluation section lacks detailed analysis of the data presented in figures and tables. Without a thorough explanation, it is difficult for readers to interpret the significance of the results and their connection to the research objectives.  
**How to Check**:  - Review each figure and table in the evaluation section and check if the findings they present are clearly explained in the text.  - Confirm that the analysis links the data to the research questions or hypotheses, explaining the trends, patterns, or anomalies.  - Ensure that quantitative metrics (such as accuracy, performance, or error rates) are adequately interpreted, and their significance is discussed.  - Look for a clear comparison between the presented data and any baseline or related work, especially if the figure/table involves comparative studies or benchmarks.- Flag any instances where the results are presented without an in-depth discussion, or where the figures/tables are simply restated without further analysis.
**How to Solve**:  - Advise the author to provide a detailed interpretation for each figure or table, discussing how the results relate to the research objectives and hypotheses. Highlight key takeaways and explain any unexpected results or trends. - Recommend comparing the findings with prior work, discussing how the presented results outperform or complement existing approaches. Ensure that the improvements or challenges shown in the data are emphasized. - Encourage the author to include specific details that quantify the improvement (e.g., "our method achieves 20% higher accuracy than the baseline") and explain why this improvement is significant for the research area.  - Suggest adding insights into the practical or theoretical implications of the results. For instance, how do these findings contribute to solving real-world problems, or how do they advance the field?  

**Mistake Name**: Insufficient Experimental Support for Main Innovations  
**Target Section**: Evaluation  
**Description**: The paperâ€™s main innovations and proposed solutions are not adequately supported by experimental evidence. Unsupported claims or conclusions reduce the credibility of the work and increase the likelihood of rejection.  
**How to Check**:  - Identify each main innovation or contribution mentioned in the introduction, methodology, or conclusion sections, and cross-check whether there are corresponding experiments or results that directly validate these innovations.- Ensure that all proposed methods or approaches have corresponding quantitative or qualitative experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness.  - Look for detailed comparisons between the proposed work and relevant baselines, benchmarks, or existing methods to verify the significance of improvements.  - Check whether each claim of improvement (e.g., higher performance, lower cost, increased efficiency) is supported with specific data or results from the experiments.  - Flag any claims that are mentioned in the text but lack sufficient experimental evidence, comparison, or validation.
**How to Solve**:  - If a main innovation or method is not experimentally supported, advise the author to design and include additional experiments that directly test and validate the claim.  - Recommend that the author compare the proposed solution with state-of-the-art methods using standard benchmarks or datasets, and present the findings with clear metrics (e.g., accuracy, runtime, memory consumption). - Suggest including ablation studies or sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the impact of individual components of the proposed solution, ensuring that each part of the innovation is validated.  - Encourage the author to provide not just numerical results but also qualitative insights into the experiment, discussing why the results are meaningful and how they support the claims made in the paper.  - If the claim cannot be supported by direct experimentation, advise the author to reword or soften the claim, making it more reflective of the limitations in the experimental validation.
