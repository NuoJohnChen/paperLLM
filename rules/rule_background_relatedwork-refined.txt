**Mistake Item UUID**: 8
**Mistake Name**: Lack of Adequate Context
**Category**: BACKGROUND
**Description**: This mistake occurs when the background section of the paper does not sufficiently guide the reader in understanding the overall field of research and the specific problem's importance that the paper addresses.
**How to Check**: Does the background start by describing the general field of computer science the research is affiliated with? Does it further narrow down to define and emphasize the specific problem being researched? Check for any unwarranted assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge concerning the topic as a sign of the mistake. Evaluate if the text aids the reader in ascertaining why it is essential to solve the problem addressed.
**How to Solve**: To correct the mistake, the student should supplement a brief summary of the wider field leading logically to a clear definition of the specific problem the paper tackles. The goal should be to build a seamless pathway that focuses from the broader field to the specific problem. The student should establish robust connections between the studied problem and its implications or prospective impact on the wider field. This process helps to fortify the contextual understanding.

**Mistake Name**: Appropriate Placement of Original Content
**Category**: RELATED_WORK
**Description**: This guideline targets scenarios wherein the introductory or background sections of the paper contain original ideas or content. Such content should ideally be presented in the main body of the paper, specifically in the methodology or results sections. Misaligned placements of original ideas can falsely imply the ideas are pre-existing in literature, impeding the paper's ability to accurately build upon its foundations.
**How to Check**: Deploy AI tools like ChatGPT 4o-mini to conduct a preliminary evaluation. The tool should be programmed to flag sections in the preliminary or background blocks which contain terms, phrases, or sentences not properly referenced to existing literature. After the AI's initial assessment, human reviewers should dissect each flagged segment to confirm the presence of original ideas or content.
**How to Solve**: In cases where improper placements are confirmed, these sections should be revised. The original content or ideas should be carefully moved to the appropriate segments like the methodology or results. The goal is to ensure the preliminary or background parts only contain well-referenced and previously established knowledge. Command the AI tool to propose the best placement in the main body for such content using metrics like semantic relatedness.

**Mistake Name**: Insufficient Emphasis on Research Novelty
**Category**: Related Work
**Description**: This mistake involves neglecting to adequately emphasize the novelty of the research in both the related work and conclusions section. This may result in the reader having difficulty understanding what makes the work distinct from other studies in the field, diminishing the perceived originality and impact of the research.
**How to Check**: Examine the related work and conclusions sections for explicit statements that describe the unique aspects of the research. Check whether these sections provide a clear contrast with prior work and articulate the new insights, methods, or results yielded by the current research. Investigate if the conclusions section re-emphasizes the novelty while discussing the broader implications of the research.
**How to Solve**: Request that the student revise the related work and conclusions sections to emphasize the unique aspects of the research. This could be done by contrasting the current work with prior similar studies, explaining what the current work achieves that earlier research didn't, and highlighting unique methods, results, or insights. The conclusions section should revisit and underscore the novelty whilst discussing the broader implications of the findings.


**Mistake Item UUID**: 4  
**Mistake Name**: Inadequate Coverage of Key Preliminary Concepts  
**Category**: Background  
**Description**: The preliminary section does not adequately cover the core concepts, definitions, or methods that are critical for understanding the technical contributions of the paper. This leads to confusion later in the paper when these concepts are used without sufficient explanation.  
**How to Check**:  - Identify all key terms, algorithms, theorems, or methodologies used in the main technical sections (such as methodology, experiments, or results). Cross-reference these elements with the preliminary section.  - Check whether these key terms are clearly defined, and methods or algorithms are explained with enough detail for readers unfamiliar with the topic to follow.  - Flag any concept or term used in the later sections that is not defined in the preliminary section or not introduced adequately before its first usage.  
**How to Solve**:  - If concepts or methods are missing, instruct the student to add concise but complete definitions and descriptions. Ensure that these are placed in a logical order and tailored to readers who may not be experts in the field. - If existing explanations are unclear, suggest rewording or providing additional context or visual aids (e.g., diagrams or examples) to make the explanation more accessible.  - Advise using standard terminology where possible to avoid ambiguity, and make sure that all symbols or abbreviations introduced are explained immediately when they appear.
