**Mistake Name**: Insufficient Detail in Algorithms
**Target Section**: TECHNICAL_SECTION
**Description**: This error occurs when algorithms are not sufficiently detailed, making replication difficult. Important steps or edge cases might be missing, or assumptions are not clearly stated.
**How to Check**: Use the AI to highlight areas in the document where algorithms are discussed. Check if the text provides enough detail for a third-party reader to recreate the algorithm without any extra resources. Check for missing steps, edge cases, initialization details, or unstated assumptions.
**How to Solve**: Use the AI to suggest missing information based on the context of the document and common patterns in algorithm description. If incomplete, authors should be encouraged to provide detailed pseudocode or flowcharts and indicate all steps, including edge cases and initialization details. Comments or explanations should be added for non-obvious steps. In case of unstated assumptions, authors should be encouraged to clearly state all assumptions before the algorithm presentation. For assumptions, authors should be encouraged to provide a clear explanation of why the assumptions are made and what the implications are if the assumptions do not hold, and if possible, provide a solution to the problem that arises from the assumptions not holding.

**Mistake Name**: Analyze the Technical Challenges
**Target Section**: TECHNICAL_SECTION
**Description**: Analyze the technical challenges and provide sufficient detail and insight into their complexity and importance in the context of the research.
**How to Check**: Review the paper to see if the technical challenges: 1) Are clearly defined and articulated 2) Demonstrate complexity and relevance 3) Are impactful in the context of the research 4) Include an explanation of why these challenges have not been adequately addressed in the literature 5) Justify why they require further study or research.
**How to Solve**: If the challenges appear minor, expand on their complexity and importance, making clear why they are key hurdles to be solved in the field of study. The severity and potential impact of the challenges should be emphasized. For instance, instead of just stating "One challenge is X", provide more detail and context. For example, "A key challenge in the domain of X is the critical balance between performance and scalability, particularly considering the increasing demands of real-world applications. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed, with solutions often compromising one for the other, thus rendering them sub-optimal for wider adoption.

**Mistake Name**: Lack of Emphasis on Methodological Rigor
**Target Section**: TECHNICAL_SECTION
**Description**: The paper does not sufficiently highlight the rigorous nature of the methodology. This flaw can lead to concerns about the validity and reproducibility of the proposed research.
**How to Check**: The AI should parse the methodology section for completeness, detail-orientedness, and comprehensiveness. The section should explicitly detail how the data will be collected, analyzed, and validated. The absence of this information indicates an area for improvement.
**How to Solve**: Instruct the AI to suggest additional details for the methodology section, such as specifying the methods for data collection, the statistical techniques for analyzing data, validation mechanisms, and justifications for chosen methods. The AI should also advise on explaining how each step contributes to the overall rigor and reliability of the research.

**Mistake Name**: Inconsistent Terminology
**Target Section**: TECHNICAL_SECTION
**Description**: The paper uses inconsistent or undefined terminology, which can confuse the reader. This not only applies to the introduction but throughout the paper.
**How to Check**: Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key terms within the paper. Then, use Coreference Resolution to spot any inconsistencies in their usage. Also, cross-verify if all the key terms are defined at their first usage.
**How to Solve**: Establish a consistent terminology within the paper. Make sure that all key entities introduced are explicitly defined at first usage and ensure the same naming convention is used throughout the paper. If different terminology is required to be used for the same concept, make a clear explanation to avoid confusion.


**Mistake Name**: Assumptions Without Justification
**Target Section**: TECHNICAL_SECTION
**Description**: Any part of the paper, not just the motivation section, may include assumptions about the problem, proposed solution, hypotheses, or the field which are not clearly justified or supported by evidence. These unjustified assumptions could appear as implicit or explicit claims.
**How to Check**: Check for any statements serving as the basis for arguments, hypotheses or conclusions that aren't justified. These can be identified as claims not followed or prefaced by supportive data, logical argumentation, or citation of relevant literature.
**How to Solve**: Ensure that all assumptions, hypotheses or foundational claims are supported by logical explanations, experimental data, or referenced research findings from credible sources. If an assumption arises from common knowledge in the field, briefly acknowledge this consensus for clarity. Refer to authoritative and credible sources wherever possible to solidify these justifications.


**Mistake Name**: Weak Rationale and Problem-Solving Approach
**Target Section**: TECHNICAL_SECTION
**Description**: The rationale behind the proposed solution isn't fully outlined, or leaves ambiguity regarding how it addresses the stated problems. The linkage between the proposed solution and the problem it aims to solve is not clearly presented.
**How to Check**: Ensure the paper includes a comprehensive motivation section in which the problems are stated clearly, with sufficient context and specifics. Check if the paper discusses the thought process behind the proposed solution, in a way that logically and clearly connects it to the problem statements. Determine whether the techniques developed and their anticipated outcomes are solidly grounded in the problems identified.
**How to Solve**: Include a dedicated section that redefines the stated problems with specificity, giving readers a clear roadmap of what the paper is addressing. Follow this with an explanation of the proposed solution and the driving forces behind its development. Clearly draw ties between the problems and solution, illustrating how the latter addresses the former with sufficient details in rationales. Consider using examples or case scenarios to demonstrate your arguments, as well as concise yet powerful language for clarity. The solution's relevance to the problems should be clear at first glance.

**Mistake Name**: Overview of Entire System Missing
**Target Section**: TECHNICAL_SECTION
**Description**: Check if the paper includes a comprehensive overview of the entire system. The overview should describe the problem the system addresses, the purpose of the system, its key components, and how these components interact.
**How to Check**: Look for a section or paragraph in the paper that provides a summary of the system. This summary should clearly define what the system does, its key features, and how these features work together to fulfill the system's intended purpose.
**How to Solve**: If such section is missing, suggest the author to include an introductory paragraph describing the system as a whole. The paragraph should start with defining the problem and end with clearly introducing the proposed systemâ€™s components and their interaction for problem-solving.


**Mistake Name**: Missing Theoretical Justification or complexity analysis
**Target Section**: TECHNICAL_SECTION
**Description**: The paper primarily emphasizes empirical results without providing clear theoretical foundation, justification or explanation for the approaches and methods chosen.
**How to Check**: The tool should scan for theoretical arguments that support the proposed approach. These might include representations of lemmas, theorems, or propositions that explain why the chosen method is expected to succeed.
**How to Solve**: Encourage the author to present a theoretical groundwork for their proposed methodology. This could include propounding and proving relevant theorems or providing a theoretical analysis that complements and gives credence to their empirical findings. Additionally, complexity analysis should be provided to showcase the efficiency of the proposed method.
