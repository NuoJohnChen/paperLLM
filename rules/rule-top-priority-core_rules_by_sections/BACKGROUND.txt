**Mistake Name**: Insufficient Context
**Target Section**: BACKGROUND
**Description**: This mistake happens when the paper's background section doesn't adequately set the stage for the reader about what the paper is about and why the explored problem is crucial.
**How to Check**: Does the background briefly describe the broader field of computer science the research falls under? Does it then narrow down to define the specific problem? If it makes unfounded assumptions about the reader's pre-existing knowledge about the topic, it’s a signal of this mistake. Also, consider if the writing helps the reader to understand why the problem needs to be solved.
**How to Solve**: The student should add a brief overview of the broader field and then a succinct explanation of the research problem their paper addresses. They should aim to build a logical flow that gradually narrows the focus from the larger field to the specific problem. It would be beneficial to draw a clear link between the studied problem and its significance or potential impact on the broader field, to solidify the context.

**Mistake Name**: Inadequate Coverage of Key Preliminary Concepts
**Target Section**: BACKGROUND
**Description**: The preliminary section does not adequately cover the core concepts, definitions, or methods that are critical for understanding the technical contributions of the paper. This leads to confusion later in the paper when these concepts are used without sufficient explanation.
**How to Check**: - Identify all key terms, algorithms, theorems, or methodologies used in the main technical sections (such as methodology, experiments, or results). Cross-reference these elements with the preliminary section.  - Check whether these key terms are clearly defined, and methods or algorithms are explained with enough detail for readers unfamiliar with the topic to follow.  - Flag any concept or term used in the later sections that is not defined in the preliminary section or not introduced adequately before its first usage.
**How to Solve**: - If concepts or methods are missing, instruct the student to add concise but complete definitions and descriptions. Ensure that these are placed in a logical order and tailored to readers who may not be experts in the field. - If existing explanations are unclear, suggest rewording or providing additional context or visual aids (e.g., diagrams or examples) to make the explanation more accessible.  - Advise using standard terminology where possible to avoid ambiguity, and make sure that all symbols or abbreviations introduced are explained immediately when they appear.

**Mistake Name**: Inconsistent or Undefined Terminology
**Target Section**: BACKGROUND
**Description**: The background section uses inconsistent or undefined terminology, which can confuse the reader and undermine the clarity of the foundational concepts. It is important that terms, concepts, and methodologies referenced in the background are consistently defined and aligned with their usage in the rest of the paper.
**How to Check**: - Identify all key terms, concepts, and methods introduced in the background section and ensure they are consistently used throughout the paper.  - Cross-reference the terminology in the background with later sections (such as technical methods, experiments, or discussions) to ensure that the same terms are used consistently and are not redefined or altered without explanation.  - Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key terms in the background and throughout the paper. Then, employ Coreference Resolution to verify that the terminology is applied consistently from the background section onward.  - Check if all key terms are defined clearly at their first occurrence in the background and, where necessary, further explained or elaborated upon to ensure the reader’s understanding.
**How to Solve**: - Ensure that all terms and concepts introduced in the background are defined clearly, using standard and consistent terminology that aligns with the broader field. - If multiple terminologies are commonly used in the literature, provide clear explanations or justifications for any deviations or alternate names.  - Advise the author to use footnotes or parenthetical explanations if alternative terms must be introduced, ensuring the reader is not confused by shifting terminology.  - Recommend conducting a final cross-check of the paper to ensure that all key terms introduced in the background are used consistently in the main sections, without any undefined shifts in terminology.
