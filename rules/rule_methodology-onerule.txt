**Mistake Item UUID**: 831
**Mistake Name**: Analyze the Technical Challenges
**Category**: TECHNICAL_SECTION
**Description**: Analyze the technical challenges and provide sufficient detail and insight into their complexity and importance in the context of the research.
**How to Check**: Review the paper to see if the technical challenges: 1) Are clearly defined and articulated 2) Demonstrate complexity and relevance 3) Are impactful in the context of the research 4) Include an explanation of why these challenges have not been adequately addressed in the literature 5) Justify why they require further study or research.
**How to Solve**: If the challenges appear minor, expand on their complexity and importance, making clear why they are key hurdles to be solved in the field of study. The severity and potential impact of the challenges should be emphasized. For instance, instead of just stating "One challenge is X", provide more detail and context. For example, "A key challenge in the domain of X is the critical balance between performance and scalability, particularly considering the increasing demands of real-world applications. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed, with solutions often compromising one for the other, thus rendering them sub-optimal for wider adoption.
