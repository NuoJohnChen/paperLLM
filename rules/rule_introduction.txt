**Mistake Name**: Review of Existing Approaches
**Category**: INTRODUCTION
**Description**: Verify if the introduction includes a review of current literature and research in the topic area of the paper.
**How to Check**: Evaluate if the introduction contains references to previous works, a brief explanation of their concepts and methodologies, and a critique of their limitations.
**How to Solve**: If such analysis is missing or incomplete, recommend the author to conduct a comprehensive literature review and incorporate the discussions into the introduction. Provide examples of how to comment on the methodologies and limitations of previous works. Encourage the inclusion of a quantitative comparison where applicable.

**Mistake Name**: Introduction Relevance
**Category**: INTRODUCTION
**Description**: Evaluate if the introduction section aligns with and introduces the paperâ€™s main narrative effectively.

**Mistake Name**: Overly Broad or Narrow Scope
**Category**: INTRODUCTION
**Description**: The introduction either covers excessive topics beyond the focus research area or concentrates extremely closely on a small piece of the research question, thereby taking away the chance to provide a comprehensive overview of the subject.
**How to Check**: Determine if multiple topics or research areas are mentioned that should fall outside the scope of this paper. Also, check if the introduction is overly detailed on a specific aspect, thus neglecting the rest of the topic. If an introduction begins with a global context then narrows down to the research question, it's usually well-structured.
**How to Solve**: The introduction should begin with a broad, general context then progressively narrow down to the research question. Remove additional topics that are not necessary for understanding the context of the research. If the introduction is too specific, broaden the context by providing additional background information or linking the research to a larger area of study.

**Mistake Name**: Misalignment Between the Introduction and Conclusion
**Category**: INTRODUCTION
**Description**: The introduction sets up specific expectations or statements that are not addressed or completed in the conclusion, leading to a gap between the beginning and ending narratives.
**How to Check**: Systematically identify key promises or statements in the introduction. Proceed to systematically analyze the conclusion for these statements, confirming their presence or identifying their absence.
**How to Solve**: Suggest multiple solutions for each identified issue. For instance, revising certain lines in the introduction to be more reflective of the paper's actual content, or adding lines to the conclusion to satisfy the initial promises of the introduction. Additionally, for each solution, provide a sentence or section level rewrite with the proposed changes.
