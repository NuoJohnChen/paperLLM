**Mistake Name**: Ignoring the Audience’s Perspective
**Category**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: The abstract is written from the author's perspective rather than considering what the audience, in this case the reviewers, needs to know. This can result in the use of excessive jargon, omission of necessary context, or inclusion of irrelevant details.
**How to Check**: Determine whether the abstract uses excessive technical terminology that may not be easily understood by reviewers. Consider if the abstract provides necessary context to understand the research. Check if the abstract includes irrelevant details that do not contribute to understanding the purpose, methods, or results of the research.
**How to Solve**: Rewrite the abstract with the following points in mind: 1) Minimize the use of technical jargon unless absolutely necessary, and provide clear definitions or explanations for any technical terminology that is used. 2) Ensure that the abstract provides all necessary context for understanding the purpose, methods, and results of the research. 3) Exclude any details that do not contribute to understanding the research from the reviewers' perspective.

**Mistake Name**: Overstating Contributions
**Category**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: Making claims in the abstract or results section that are too grandiose, unsupported by the studies conducted, or not fully linked with the evidence presented. Overstatements may come in the form of exaggerating the importance of the findings, claiming a larger scope than the study supports, or drawing conclusions not supported by the data. 1. Compare the statements in the abstract and results sections with the actual studies conducted and the data presented. 2. Look for hyperbolic language or overly broad statements. 3. Look for conclusions or implications that go beyond the scope of the study or the data.
**How to Check**: **How to Solve**: 1. Rewrite the overstated sections with language that better matches the scope, importance, and context of the findings as reported in the body of the paper. 2. Align the claims about the contributions with the actual findings, ensuring to anchor them in the data presented. 3. Avoid making broad statements that cannot be supported by the data. Instead, stick to what the data can reasonably suggest, even if it's more limited in scope.

**Mistake Name**: Inconsistencies in Paper Abstract
**Category**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: The abstract contains different results, methods or conclusions than those presented in the body of the paper.
**How to Check**: Compare the main points and results in the abstract with those in the paper's introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections. Pay special attention to differences in detail that could indicate a discrepancy.
**How to Solve**: Update the abstract to mirror exactly the structure, content and results of the paper. Ensure that the methods, results and conclusions mentioned are those that are discussed in detail within the paper.

**Mistake Name**: Ambiguous or Weak Conclusion
**Category**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: The conclusion of the abstract is vague, weak, doesn't effectively summarize the research, or fails to highlight the technical advancement and its specific contribution.
**How to Check**: The model should review not just the final sentences, but the entire conclusion of the paper. It should check if the conclusion explicitly states and summarises the steps undertaken in the research, the key outcomes, the significance of those outcomes, and the contribution to the field of computer science.
**How to Solve**: The conclusion should be revised to include clear statements of the primary technical advancements and their specific contributions, focusing on the quantifiable or qualitative improvements brought about by the research. The revision should ensure that these details are easy to understand, and the language used is concise and unambiguous.

**Mistake Name**: Poorly Defined Objectives
**Category**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: The research objectives are not clearly defined, are too broad, or they lack focus on the main aspects of the research. They might not state what the study aims to achieve, don't align with the research problem, or are not specific enough to guide the readers.
**How to Check**: Look for a clear and specific statement of the research objectives within the abstract. These should be brief but comprehensive, should address the research problem and should indicate the research methods as well as the expected results. It is essential to make sure that the objectives align with the research question and are not too broad or vague that they fail to convey the main goals of the research.
**How to Solve**: Refine the objectives to be concise, specific, and measurable. Make sure they directly link to the research problem and they showcase the main aim of the research. Each objective should represent a step towards solving the research problem, make it explicit what the study does and does not aim to achieve and make it clear how the objectives contribute to new understandings or advancements in the field.

**Mistake Item UUID**: 147
**Mistake Name**: Lack of Motivation
**Category**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: Not accurately and explicitly expressing the motivation behind the research, resulting in ambiguity regarding the purpose of the work.
**How to Check**: Verify the abstract introduces the purpose of the study. Look for expressions or statements that connect the research to a broader issue, concept, or problem in the field of Computer Science. Check if the abstract clearly answers the question "What problem does this research intend to solve?"
**How to Solve**: Insert a concise yet comprehensive statement indicating the purpose of the research. Relate the research to a wider issue in the field of Computer Science or a specific problem unsolved thus far. One effective approach might be starting with a broad context, then narrowing it down to the specific issue the paper addresses.

**Mistake Name**: Title Doesn’t Match Content
**Category**: TITLE
**Description**: Examine the title, abstract, and introduction to ensure they all allude to the same main topics, findings, or arguments presented within the paper. Identifying discrepancies in main themes or any off-topic detours from the main subject between these sections.
**How to Check**: Parse the title, abstract, and introduction in terms of the significant terms and themes they include. Check for consistency across these elements. Use frequent keywords or phrases from the paper to draw conclusions about main themes and arguments.
**How to Solve**: If the title does not reflect the main themes, findings, or arguments, adjust it to incorporate or encapsulate the primary keywords, terminology or concepts contained within the abstract and introduction. The title should provide a concise summary of the paper's focus.

**Mistake Item UUID**: 303
**Mistake Name**: Redundancy
**Category**: TITLE
**Description**: The title of a paper should be concise and clear, rendering unnecessary repetition of ideas or words. Redundancy in the title could lead to a lack of clarity and diminish the concision and impact of the title.
**How to Check**: Identify words or phrases that are used more than once in the title which can be removed without losing the main idea. Also, look for synonyms or rephrased concepts that basically say the same thing.
**How to Solve**: Replace repeated words with alternative vocabulary if necessary to retain the meaning of the sentence or simply eliminate the redundant words or ideas. Ensure that the adjusted title still communicates the main theme or aim of the paper accurately.
