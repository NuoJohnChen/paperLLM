**Mistake Name**: Lack of Structure
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: Disorganized Flow in Paper
**How to Check**: The AI should scan for keyword and topic continuity between adjacent paragraphs and sections. It should inspect if there are abrupt topic changes or conclusions that do not seem logically connected to the preceding text. Also, the AI should look at the thematic development from introduction to conclusion.
**How to Solve**: The AI should flag any abrupt topic changes, lack of logical coherence, unconnected conclusions or introductions. For fixing these issues, the AI could suggest adding transition sentences, providing more context, reordering paragraphs, or rephrasing awkward sentences to improve readability.

**Mistake Name**: Inadequate Problem Definition
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The problem definition might be too generalized, unclear, or poorly stated, obscuring the precise research focus. A good problem definition should incorporate the current state of affairs, the ideal situation, the gap between them, and how the research aims to bridge this distance.
**How to Check**: Verify that the problem definition includes four key elements: current situation, ideal situation, the gap (unmet needs or challenges), and how the research intends to address it. If any of these components are unclear or missing, or if it's challenging to discern the problem being tackled, the definition may be too ambiguous.
**How to Solve**: Request the student to hone the problem definition by pinpointing to distinct, quantifiable issues that tie directly to the research objectives. Encourage them to describe the current and ideal situations and specify the challenges and their proposed solutions. Consider providing them with template structures for problem definitions to guide their thinking and writing.

**Mistake Name**: Lack of Emphasis on Methodological Rigor
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The paper does not sufficiently highlight the rigorous nature of the methodology. This flaw can lead to concerns about the validity and reproducibility of the proposed research.
**How to Check**: The AI should parse the methodology section for completeness, detail-orientedness, and comprehensiveness. The section should explicitly detail how the data will be collected, analyzed, and validated. The absence of this information indicates an area for improvement.
**How to Solve**: Instruct the AI to suggest additional details for the methodology section, such as specifying the methods for data collection, the statistical techniques for analyzing data, validation mechanisms, and justifications for chosen methods. The AI should also advise on explaining how each step contributes to the overall rigor and reliability of the research.

**Mistake Name**: Lack of Originality
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The document does not adequately show how the research offers novel solutions or contributes new information to its field.
**How to Check**: The ChatGPT can be set to examine if there are segments in the paper that directly mention the novelty or originality of the proposed research compared to the citations provided in the same text. It should also look for keywords such as 'innovation', 'novel', 'unique', 'first-time', 'unprecedented', etc.
**How to Solve**: The tool should recommend that the author(s) provide a separate section to emphasize the innovative aspects of their work, its potential impact and how it specifically contributes to the existing literature in a way not yet achieved by previous research.

**Mistake Name**: Weak Conclusion and Future Work Sections
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The conclusion might not effectively summarize the research contributions, or the future work section may lack vision and specificity.
**How to Check**: Evaluate whether the conclusion ties together all the research findings and whether the future work section provides clear and realistic directions for continued research. Check for specific techniques, methods or theories applied and how well they've been expanded upon in the conclusion. See if the future work section clearly foresees potential challenges and opportunities from the present research outcomes.
**How to Solve**: Teach the student to write a compelling conclusion that synthesizes their contributions and salient points of their research, and to anticipate key questions that could be answered in subsequent studies. Advise using precise and explicit language when articulating future directions and the relevance of their research to their discipline.

**Mistake Name**: Absence of High-Level Paper Outline
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: Ensure the introduction includes a high-level paper outline, framing the structure and main points to be discussed in the rest of the paper.
**How to Check**: Look for a paragraph in the introduction that summarizes the structure of the rest of the paper. It should include phrases like, "The remainder of this paper", "The following sections", "This paper will further discuss", etc. This paragraph often comes near the end of the introduction.
**How to Solve**: If missing, draft a succinct paragraph describing the structure and main points of the remaining sections of the paper. For instance, "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 will discuss X, followed by a deeper analysis of Y in Section 3. Section 4 explores possible implications of Z, and the conclusion summarizes the main findings and suggests areas for further research."

**Mistake Name**: Inadequate Summary of Observations
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The motivation section fails to effectively summarize the key observations or lacks a clear link between the identified problems and the proposed solution. This weakens the argument for the necessity of proposed research.
**How to Check**: Verify if the observations are merely listed without detailed explanation. Check for the presence of a summarizing statement that encompasses the main points and links the issues to the motivation for new research. Finally, look for explicit statements highlighting the importance of the proposed solution in context of the identified issues.
**How to Solve**: After enumerating the observations, they should be neatly wrapped up with a summary that is attached to a broader narrative or research question. Make sure to clearly associate the identified problems with the requirement for a new approach, thereby setting a robust ground for your proposed solution.

**Mistake Name**: Missing Key Papers Discussion
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: Ensure that the paper includes references and discussions of key publications that are relevant and have significantly contributed to the field.
**How to Check**: Has the paper referenced and analysed the most relevant and influential publications within the specific field?
**How to Solve**: If missing, recommend conducting a more comprehensive literature review to find relevant key papers. The author should then revise their discussion to include an analysis of these papers, discussing their importance, findings, and how they relate to the present research.

**Mistake Name**: Ignoring Alternative Approaches
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: A comprehensive review of alternative approaches or previous methods is not present or insufficient and the paper does not effectively place the study within the broader academic context. The rationale for choosing the adopted approach over alternatives may not be clearly explained or justified.
**How to Check**: Use the AI to identify any mentions of alternative or previously employed methods within the paper. Check whether these are discussed critically, comparing their merits and drawbacks to those of the chosen approach. Evaluate if the paper properly situates the presented research method within the broader context of the field. The focus should be on the Background or Literature Review sections primarily.
**How to Solve**: Guide the student to integrate an evaluation of different methods that have been used in the field, along with a clear justification for why the selected approach was chosen. Encourage critical comparison of the different approaches, even possibly suggesting some common alternatives if they're missing. Also prompt the student to better contextualize their research and method within the broader academic discussion.

**Mistake Name**: Ignoring Negative Results
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The paper only reports positive results, thereby neglecting the inclusion of experiments that did not yield expected outcomes or performed below par.
**How to Check**: Probe for the presence of a section or statement specifying unexpected or unfavorable outcomes. The paper should encompass both the favorable and unfavorable aspects of the experiment to furnish a balanced viewpoint.
**How to Solve**: If a deficit of discussion regarding negative results is found, the writer should be encouraged to incorporate a discussion concerning the negative results or experiments that underperformed. It is important for the writer to expand on why these results transpired and what implications can be drawn from them.

**Mistake Name**: Lack of Detailed Comparative Analysis
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The paper does not adequately compare the proposed method to existing methods. It focuses solely on raw performance metrics without considering other important factors such as efficiency, resource utilization, scalability, robustness, etc.
**How to Check**: Verify whether the paper includes a thorough comparative analysis that not only compares the raw performance metrics but also provides a discussion on how the proposed method performs in aspects like efficiency, resource utilization, scalability, and robustness against existing methods.
**How to Solve**: Introduce a comprehensive comparative analysis section. Include quantitative metrics that showcase the performance comparison and a qualitative exposition discussing how the proposed method stacks up against existing methods in other crucial areas like efficiency, resource utilization, scalability, etc.

**Mistake Name**: Failure to Justify Experiment Design
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The design of experiments is either lacking in clear reasoning or is not justified in terms of the choice of datasets, parameters, or baselines. This makes the evaluation appear arbitrary and can reduce the overall quality and credibility of the paper.
**How to Check**: Ensure the paper includes details about why specific datasets, parameters, or baselines were adopted in the experiment design. Check for clear explanations on how these aspects align with the research goals and the logic behind these choices.
**How to Solve**: Improve sections where the justifications for the experiment design are weak. Questions to consider include: Why were specific datasets or parameters selected? How do these choices align with the research goals? How were baselines chosen? By addressing these queries, the researcher can offer a systematic account of their experiment design and its correlation with their research objectives.

**Mistake Name**: Failure to Address Data Imbalance
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The paper does not adequately address the challenges, implications, and strategies for handling imbalanced datasets, leading to possibly biased results and unreliable model performance. Assess whether the paper thoroughly discusses data imbalance in the context of the proposed model or theory, its potential impact on the model's performance and conclusions drawn, as well as the appropriate mitigation techniques incorporated.
**How to Check**: Scan through the paper for mentions of data imbalance in the Methodology, Experiment and Results sections. Look for explicit mention of how data imbalance was handled, if the models were tested on balanced/unbalanced datasets and the process used to balance the datasets, if applicable. Check whether the paper has considered the impact of data imbalance while proposing its methodology or discussing its results.
**How to Solve**: If data imbalance is found to be an overlooked issue, the paper should be revised to incorporate effective techniques to mitigate it. This can include discussions and implementations of under-sampling, over-sampling, or synthetic minority over-sampling techniques. Specialized models that handle imbalanced data should be considered, or certain evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, or area under ROC, which are less susceptible to imbalanced datasets, could be used. Further, the paper should discuss the implications of these techniques and their effectiveness in achieving balanced data, and how this significantly impacts the model's performance and generalizability.

**Mistake Name**: Title, Abstract Inaccuracy, and Inappropriate Keywords
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The title and abstract may not accurately reflect the paper's content or findings. Keywords might be missing, irrelevant, or vagely tied to the paper's subject matter.
**How to Check**: AI could evaluate if the title and abstract includes relevant terminology and touch upon the major themes of the paper. AI could also check if keywords are present and if they align with the predominant themes in the paper.
**How to Solve**: Based on the AI's recommendations, revise the title and abstract for accuracy and clarity. Consult latest published papers in the field for refining keywords. Give some example revisions.

**Mistake Name**: Overly Ambitious Claims
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The introduction, or any part of the document, contains claims about the research findings that overstep its boundaries. These claims could be about its impact, practicality, or novelty, which further extends the implications of the research.
**How to Check**: Look for statements that make bold proclamations about the research's importance and potential broad applicability. Keep an eye out for phrases such as "groundbreaking," "revolutionising," "unprecedented," without providing enough evidence through experimental data or exact findings to back up these terminologies.
**How to Solve**: Remove or modify any excessive, overly optimistic language and replace it with more neutral, balanced statements that accurately reflect the paper's contributions. For instance, instead of claiming that the paper will 'revolutionise' a field, indicate how the results provide a novel approach or perspective on a particular problem within the field. The impact statements should always align with the data presented in the paper.

**Mistake Name**: Inconsistent Terminology
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The paper uses inconsistent or undefined terminology, which can confuse the reader. This not only applies to the introduction but throughout the paper.
**How to Check**: Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key terms within the paper. Then, use Coreference Resolution to spot any inconsistencies in their usage. Also, cross-verify if all the key terms are defined at their first usage.
**How to Solve**: Establish a consistent terminology within the paper. Make sure that all key entities introduced are explicitly defined at first usage and ensure the same naming convention is used throughout the paper. If different terminology is required to be used for the same concept, make a clear explanation to avoid confusion.

**Mistake Name**: Lack of Contextual Background
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The introduction or literature review doesn't include enough references to existing work, or it doesn't clearly explain why the problem the paper addresses is significant in the context of the broader field.
**How to Check**: The model can check for the presence of sentences that explicitly discuss relevance or significance of the problem, and the number of references to the existing works in the related field. It can also check if there is a clear transition from discussing the existing work to stating the problem that the paper addresses.
**How to Solve**: Encourage the writer to explicitly mention the importance of the problem in the context of the wider field, discuss existing work and methods in more depth, and clearly connect them to the problem the paper addresses.

**Mistake Name**: Inconsistent or Contradictory Statements
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The paper contains inconsistent or contradictory statements that could be within sections (e.g., Introduction, Methodology, Result, Discussion, Conclusion) or across these sections, affecting the clarity and validity of the work. This includes contradiction in the problem statement, hypotheses, methodological approach, results, and conclusions drawn.
**How to Check**: Scrutinize each section for inconsistent statements or figures. Assess the link between the problem statement, research methodology, results, and conclusions. The research goals stated in the introduction should align with the methodology and findings. Additionally, the results should support the conclusions drawn.
**How to Solve**: Ensure every segment of the paper aligns with others. The problem statement or research question dictates the methodology, which in turn affects the results and the conclusion. Any change in one domain must reflect accurately across others. Redraft any contradictory or inconsistent statements for clarity and coherence. Consult relevant literature if necessary, to ensure the academic integrity of the revised content.

**Mistake Name**: Assumptions Without Justification
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: Any part of the paper, not just the motivation section, may include assumptions about the problem, proposed solution, hypotheses, or the field which are not clearly justified or supported by evidence. These unjustified assumptions could appear as implicit or explicit claims.
**How to Check**: Check for any statements serving as the basis for arguments, hypotheses or conclusions that aren't justified. These can be identified as claims not followed or prefaced by supportive data, logical argumentation, or citation of relevant literature.
**How to Solve**: Ensure that all assumptions, hypotheses or foundational claims are supported by logical explanations, experimental data, or referenced research findings from credible sources. If an assumption arises from common knowledge in the field, briefly acknowledge this consensus for clarity. Refer to authoritative and credible sources wherever possible to solidify these justifications.

**Mistake Name**: Include Introductions for Each Technical Chapter
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: Each technical chapter in your paper or thesis (typically starting from Chapter Three) should include an introduction that sets the stage for the reader. These introductions can be adapted from your original research or ideas, but they should be revised to ensure they fit seamlessly into the broader narrative.
**How to Check**: Examine the beginning of each technical chapter and look for an introduction. Determine whether the introduction adequately introduces the topic of the chapter and fits into the broader narrative of the paper or thesis.
**How to Solve**: If the introduction is taken from another source (such as an original paper), revise the introduction to remove references specific to the original source (e.g., “In this paper”) and replace them with language that fits the context of the paper or thesis (e.g., “In this chapter”). Ensure each introduction ties back to the main theme or problem statement of the paper.

**Mistake Name**: Tables that Do Not Support the Argument
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: Ensure that every table in the paper directly supports the argument or analysis being presented. Tables should add value and help clarify or elaborate your argument.
**How to Check**: Check each table's content and its relation to the argument in the text. Tables should enhance understanding of the text and its arguments.
**How to Solve**: Tables that do not directly contribute to the paper’s argument must be reassessed. Consider removing these tables or revise them so that they directly contribute to the argument. If certain information from the table remains useful, consider incorporating it into the text.

**Mistake Name**: Missing Theoretical Justification
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The paper primarily emphasizes empirical results without providing clear theoretical foundation, justification or explanation for the approaches and methods chosen.
**How to Check**: The tool should scan for theoretical arguments that support the proposed approach. These might include representations of lemmas, theorems, or propositions that explain why the chosen method is expected to succeed.
**How to Solve**: Encourage the author to present a theoretical groundwork for their proposed methodology. This could include propounding and proving relevant theorems or providing a theoretical analysis that complements and gives credence to their empirical findings. Additionally, precise references from existing literature can substantiate the theoretical framework further.

**Mistake Name**: Justification of Methodology/System Design

**Description**: Check if the methodology/system design is justified. This includes justifying the use of certain algorithm, the choice of an architecture, etc.
**How to Check**: Look for clear and supported statements about why the selected methodology or system design is suitable for the specific problem. Patterns to identify include assertions about the methodology or design without clear explanations or support.
**How to Solve**: Highlight the general area where justification is needed. Suggest that the author provide a paragraph justifying the methodology, explain why a certain algorithm was chosen (efficiency, accuracy, etc), or clarify why the chosen architecture is ideal or sufficient for the problem at hand. Keep in mind that due to lack of domain knowledge, ChatGPT 4o-mini might not reliably generate the justifying paragraph itself.

**Mistake Name**: Motivation Explanation
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: Check if the paper adequately outlines the motivation for solving the problem in the introduction.
**How to Check**: Make the tool evaluate if the introduction provides a clear explanation for the motivation behind the paper's research. The motivation should underline the importance and relevance of the problem being tackled.
**How to Solve**: If motivation is missing or inadequate, the tool can suggest the paper author to provide more depth, stressing the implications if the problem remains unsolved. However, providing specific real-world examples and conducting a quantitative analysis, tailored to the paper's topic, will still require human intervention. As a workaround, the tool can frame open ended questions prompting the authors to think in these lines. For example: "What are potential real-world implications of your research?" or "What are the numerical measures that underscore the urgency of your problem?".

**Mistake Name**: Over-Reliance on Heuristics
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The proposed methodology is heavily dependent on heuristics without supplying adequate rationalization for their effectiveness or analyzing the influence of these heuristics on the final outcome.
**How to Check**: Detect the segments of the paper where heuristics are employed. Look for the following type of justifications: empirical evidence, theoretical analysis, references to previous works, and logical explanations. Establish if the impact of the heuristic on the findings is mentioned.
**How to Solve**: Provide either empirical evidence, theoretical analysis, references to the literature, or logical explanations to rationalize the use of the heuristics. Again, the impact of the heuristic on the outputs should be explained or discussed. Ideally, include a sensitivity analysis to showcase how changes in heuristic can affect the results.

**Mistake Name**: Section Relevance
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: Check if each section of the paper contributes to advancing the main narrative.
**How to Check**: Identify the role of the section in the overall storyline. Ask: Does the content of each section add new information or ideas relevant to the main narrative?
**How to Solve**: Suggest a reorganization of content such that each section contributes significantly to the narrative. If a section is irrelevant, suggest its removal or replacement with a more relevant section.

**Mistake Name**: Weak Rationale and Problem-Solving Approach
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The rationale behind the proposed solution isn't fully outlined, or leaves ambiguity regarding how it addresses the stated problems. The linkage between the proposed solution and the problem it aims to solve is not clearly presented.
**How to Check**: Ensure the paper includes a comprehensive motivation section in which the problems are stated clearly, with sufficient context and specifics. Check if the paper discusses the thought process behind the proposed solution, in a way that logically and clearly connects it to the problem statements. Determine whether the techniques developed and their anticipated outcomes are solidly grounded in the problems identified.
**How to Solve**: Include a dedicated section that redefines the stated problems with specificity, giving readers a clear roadmap of what the paper is addressing. Follow this with an explanation of the proposed solution and the driving forces behind its development. Clearly draw ties between the problems and solution, illustrating how the latter addresses the former. Consider using examples or case scenarios to demonstrate your arguments, as well as concise yet powerful language for clarity. The solution's relevance to the problems should be clear at first glance.

**Mistake Name**: Overview of Entire System Missing
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: Check if the paper includes a comprehensive overview of the entire system. The overview should describe the problem the system addresses, the purpose of the system, its key components, and how these components interact.
**How to Check**: Look for a section or paragraph in the paper that provides a summary of the system. This summary should clearly define what the system does, its key features, and how these features work together to fulfill the system's intended purpose.
**How to Solve**: If such section is missing, suggest the author to include an introductory paragraph describing the system as a whole. The paragraph should start with defining the problem and end with clearly introducing the proposed system’s components and their interaction for problem-solving.

**Mistake Name**: Lack of Integration of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Review
**Target Section**: ENTIRE_PAPER
**Description**: The SOTA review is included without demonstrating a clear relationship with the problem definition or the suggested research proposal. This can lead to disjointedness between different sections of the paper, creating confusion and diluting the impact of the research.
**How to Check**: Verify whether the SOTA review explicitly draws upon prevalent methodologies, theories, or findings to formulate the problem statement and the proposed research objective. This can be done by looking for explicit references or logical links between the SOTA review and these sections.
**How to Solve**: Instruct the student to provide explicit references or coerent links demonstrating how the SOTA review contributes to the problem definition and proposed research. This can involve reworking the writing to provide detailed justifications for methodological or theoretical choices, or articulating how the chosen research question is a natural progression from the SOTA review.
