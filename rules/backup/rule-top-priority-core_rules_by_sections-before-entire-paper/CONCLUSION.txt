**Mistake Name**: Insufficient Discussion on Broader Impact
**Target Section**: CONCLUSION
**Description**: The paper does not adequately discuss the broader impact of the research and offers no or vague suggestions for future work.
**How to Check**: Go over the conclusion or discussion sections carefully and check whether the broader impacts like societal, technological or academic implications are thoroughly discussed. Confirm if clear avenues for future research based on the current paper's findings are proposed.
**How to Solve**: Enrich the conclusion with a more detailed discussion on the broader impact of the research considering various aspects like societal, technological, regulatory or academic implications. State explicitly how your work could be a foundation for future research and provide specific examples or potential research questions that can be explored further.

**Mistake Name**: Missing Key Innovations and Findings  
**Target Section**: Conclusion  
**Description**: The conclusion fails to summarize the paper's key innovations and major findings, leaving readers unclear about the primary contributions and outcomes of the research.  
**How to Check**:  - Review the conclusion section to ensure that the key innovations introduced in the paper are clearly summarized.  - Check if the major findings or results of the research are restated with specific reference to the impact or improvements made over existing work.  - Confirm that the conclusion highlights both technical contributions and empirical results, providing a concise wrap-up of the most important points discussed in the paper.  - Flag any instances where the conclusion is overly vague or focuses too much on general information, without properly reflecting the core innovations or findings.
**How to Solve**:  - If the key innovations are not mentioned, advise the author to summarize the novel aspects of the work succinctly, including any new methodologies, frameworks, or algorithms introduced. - Suggest that the author restate the major findings, including quantitative or qualitative results, and emphasize how these findings demonstrate the success of the proposed solution or approach.  - Encourage the author to make a clear comparison between the results and existing work, underscoring the improvements made in terms of performance, efficiency, or applicability.  - Recommend that the conclusion highlights why these innovations and findings are significant, both in the context of the specific problem being addressed and in broader applications.
