**Mistake Name**: Ignoring the Audience’s Perspective
**Target Section**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: The abstract is written from the author's perspective rather than considering what the audience, in this case the reviewers, needs to know. This can result in the use of excessive jargon, omission of necessary context, or inclusion of irrelevant details.
**How to Check**: Determine whether the abstract uses excessive technical terminology that may not be easily understood by reviewers. Consider if the abstract provides necessary context to understand the research. Check if the abstract includes irrelevant details that do not contribute to understanding the purpose, methods, or results of the research.
**How to Solve**: Rewrite the abstract with the following points in mind: 1) Minimize the use of technical jargon unless absolutely necessary, and provide clear definitions or explanations for any technical terminology that is used. 2) Ensure that the abstract provides all necessary context for understanding the purpose, methods, and results of the research. 3) Exclude any details that do not contribute to understanding the research from the reviewers' perspective.

**Mistake Name**: Inconsistencies in Paper Abstract
**Target Section**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: The abstract contains different results, methods or conclusions than those presented in the body of the paper.
**How to Check**: Compare the main points and results in the abstract with those in the paper's introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections. Pay special attention to differences in detail that could indicate a discrepancy.
**How to Solve**: Update the abstract to mirror exactly the structure, content and results of the paper. Ensure that the methods, results and conclusions mentioned are those that are discussed in detail within the paper.

**Mistake Name**: Ambiguous or Weak Conclusion
**Target Section**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: The conclusion of the abstract is vague, weak, doesn't effectively summarize the research, or fails to highlight the technical advancement and its specific contribution.
**How to Check**: The model should review not just the final sentences, but the entire conclusion of the paper. It should check if the conclusion explicitly states and summarises the steps undertaken in the research, the key outcomes, the significance of those outcomes, and the contribution to the field of computer science.
**How to Solve**: The conclusion should be revised to include clear statements of the primary technical advancements and their specific contributions, focusing on the quantifiable or qualitative improvements brought about by the research. The revision should ensure that these details are easy to understand, and the language used is concise and unambiguous.

**Mistake Name**: Poorly Defined Objectives
**Target Section**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: The research objectives are not clearly defined, are too broad, or they lack focus on the main aspects of the research. They might not state what the study aims to achieve, don't align with the research problem, or are not specific enough to guide the readers.
**How to Check**: Look for a clear and specific statement of the research objectives within the abstract. These should be brief but comprehensive, should address the research problem and should indicate the research methods as well as the expected results. It is essential to make sure that the objectives align with the research question and are not too broad or vague that they fail to convey the main goals of the research.
**How to Solve**: Refine the objectives to be concise, specific, and measurable. Make sure they directly link to the research problem and they showcase the main aim of the research. Each objective should represent a step towards solving the research problem, make it explicit what the study does and does not aim to achieve and make it clear how the objectives contribute to new understandings or advancements in the field.

**Mistake Name**: Lack of Motivation
**Target Section**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: Not accurately and explicitly expressing the motivation behind the research, resulting in ambiguity regarding the purpose of the work.
**How to Check**: Verify the abstract introduces the purpose of the study. Look for expressions or statements that connect the research to a broader issue, concept, or problem in the field of Computer Science. Check if the abstract clearly answers the question "What problem does this research intend to solve?"
**How to Solve**: Insert a concise yet comprehensive statement indicating the purpose of the research. Relate the research to a wider issue in the field of Computer Science or a specific problem unsolved thus far. One effective approach might be starting with a broad context, then narrowing it down to the specific issue the paper addresses.

**Mistake Name**: Insufficient Explanation of Existing Solutions
**Target Section**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: The abstract lacks comprehensive details regarding why present solutions are inadequate, and doesn't emphasize the research gap sufficiently, making it hard for audiences to understand the novelty of the presented research.
**How to Check**: Scrutinize the complete abstract, especially the background or problem statement parts, to check if it underlines the shortcomings of present solutions clearly, and whether it easily conveys the research gap to a reader of varied expertise.
**How to Solve**: Revamp the abstract to elucidate why current solutions fall short, emphasizing the unique aspect of the proposed research in bridging this gap. The explanation should be understandable for a broad audience, ranging from experts to non-experts.

**Mistake Name**: Weak Title-Abstract Link
**Target Section**: ABSTRACT
**Description**: An abstract that doesn’t align well with the paper’s title, leading to a disconnect between the two.
**How to Check**: The model assesses whether key concepts, methods, or objectives in the title are present in the abstract, marking it as a potential issue if they are not.
**How to Solve**: Suggests the user to rework either the abstract or title for cohesion and correlation between them by keeping key concepts consistent, ensuring the abstract sheds light on the title's context.

**Mistake Name**: Insufficient Explanation of Proposed Solutions  
**Target Section**: Abstract  
**Description**: The abstract lacks comprehensive details regarding why the proposed solutions are adequate and how they sufficiently address the research gap, making it difficult for readers to understand the impact and novelty of the research.  
**How to Check**:  - Verify if the abstract mentions the specific problem or research gap being addressed. - Check whether the proposed solution is briefly described, including key methods or approaches.  
- Ensure that the abstract explains how the solution improves upon existing work or contributes to closing the identified research gap.   - Flag cases where the abstract focuses too much on background or general context without clearly highlighting the contributions or impact of the proposed solution.
**How to Solve**:  - If the problem and solution are not clearly stated, advise the author to succinctly state the research gap in the first few sentences and explicitly describe the proposed solution.  - Encourage the author to summarize the key innovation or methodology of the solution, focusing on how it directly addresses the research gap.  - Ensure that the solution is presented as an important contribution, emphasizing its relevance to the audience or field.
