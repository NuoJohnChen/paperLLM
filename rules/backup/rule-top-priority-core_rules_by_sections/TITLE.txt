**Mistake Name**: Redundancy
**Target Section**: TITLE
**Description**: The title of a paper should be concise and clear, rendering unnecessary repetition of ideas or words. Redundancy in the title could lead to a lack of clarity and diminish the concision and impact of the title.
**How to Check**: Identify words or phrases that are used more than once in the title which can be removed without losing the main idea. Also, look for synonyms or rephrased concepts that basically say the same thing.
