**Mistake Name**: Inadequate Problem Definition
**Target Section**: INTRODUCTION
**Description**: The problem definition might be too generalized, unclear, or poorly stated, obscuring the precise research focus. A good problem definition should incorporate the current state of affairs, the ideal situation, the gap between them, and how the research aims to bridge this distance.
**How to Check**: Verify that the problem definition includes four key elements: current situation, ideal situation, the gap (unmet needs or challenges), and how the research intends to address it. If any of these components are unclear or missing, or if it's challenging to discern the problem being tackled, the definition may be too ambiguous.
**How to Solve**: Request the student to hone the problem definition by pinpointing to distinct, quantifiable issues that tie directly to the research objectives. Encourage them to describe the current and ideal situations and specify the challenges and their proposed solutions. Consider providing them with template structures for problem definitions to guide their thinking and writing.

**Mistake Name**: Absence of High-Level Paper Outline
**Target Section**: INTRODUCTION
**Description**: Ensure the introduction includes a high-level paper outline, framing the structure and main points to be discussed in the rest of the paper.
**How to Check**: Look for a paragraph in the introduction that summarizes the structure of the rest of the paper. It should include phrases like, "The remainder of this paper", "The following sections", "This paper will further discuss", etc. This paragraph often comes near the end of the introduction.
**How to Solve**: If missing, draft a succinct paragraph describing the structure and main points of the remaining sections of the paper. For instance, "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 will discuss X, followed by a deeper analysis of Y in Section 3. Section 4 explores possible implications of Z, and the conclusion summarizes the main findings and suggests areas for further research."

**Mistake Name**: Overly Ambitious Claims
**Target Section**: INTRODUCTION
**Description**: The introduction, or any part of the document, contains claims about the research findings that overstep its boundaries. These claims could be about its impact, practicality, or novelty, which further extends the implications of the research.
**How to Check**: Look for statements that make bold proclamations about the research's importance and potential broad applicability. Keep an eye out for phrases such as "groundbreaking," "revolutionising," "unprecedented," without providing enough evidence through experimental data or exact findings to back up these terminologies.
**How to Solve**: Remove or modify any excessive, overly optimistic language and replace it with more neutral, balanced statements that accurately reflect the paper's contributions. For instance, instead of claiming that the paper will 'revolutionise' a field, indicate how the results provide a novel approach or perspective on a particular problem within the field. The impact statements should always align with the data presented in the paper.

**Mistake Name**: Lack of Integration of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Review in Problem Framing
**Target Section**: INTRODUCTION
**Description**: The introduction does not adequately integrate the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) review to frame the problem or motivate the proposed research. This leads to a weak connection between the current research landscape and the problem being addressed, making it difficult for the reader to understand the significance and context of the work.
**How to Check**: - Check if the introduction provides a clear link between the SOTA review and the problem statement. Look for explicit references to key works, methodologies, or findings from the SOTA that directly highlight the gaps or limitations the research aims to address. - Verify that the SOTA is not just mentioned in passing but is used to build a logical argument that justifies the need for the proposed research.  - Ensure that the research objectives or questions naturally flow from the SOTA review, showing how the paper builds upon or extends existing work.  - Cross-reference the introduction with the later sections (such as Related Work and Methodology) to ensure that the SOTA review introduced in the introduction is consistently connected to the research proposal.
**How to Solve**: - Advise the author to revise the introduction to explicitly state how the SOTA review informs the problem definition. Encourage them to include clear references to key works that highlight gaps, unresolved challenges, or limitations in the field.  - Recommend linking specific methodologies or findings from the SOTA to the research objectives, explaining how the proposed work builds upon or differs from these previous efforts.  - Suggest reworking the introduction to provide a clear justification for the proposed research, using the SOTA as a foundation for the argument. This may involve restructuring the introduction to first outline the current state of research, then identify gaps or limitations, and finally introduce the proposed solution as a logical next step.  - Ensure that the SOTA review is integrated into the overall narrative of the introduction to create a cohesive and compelling argument.
